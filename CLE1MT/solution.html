						<h2 class="Stitle">Educate Children</h2>
						<p class="center">
							Educating the children is an act where we should teach the younger generations a more clear explanation on what is right and wrong. Rather than making
                            decisions for themselves, Let's give them a proper amount of education for their future.

					<div id="section">
						<h2 class="Stitle">Support Environmental Programs</h2>
						<p class="center">
							Supporting programs that encourage the cleanliness of our own community makes it easier for us to learn more about proper waste disposal and management.
                            We cannot make a comfortable place to live in if we do not throw our garbage properly.
						</p>

					<div id="section">
						<h2 class="Stitle">Prevent Child Marriage</h2>
						<p class="center">
							Child Marriage Robs Humans of Their Childhood. Let us stop this kind of practice because early birth and marriage will lead to financial crisis. At a young age,
                            the young should be in school and studying. Be responsible of your own children. Teach them what is wrong and what is right.
						</p>

                    <div id="section">
						<h2 class="Stitle">Ensure Basic Health Care</h2>
						<p class="center">
							Every city or town should have basic health care. It is the local government's job to assure their own people that they have proper health needs if ever an outbreak
                            strikes. Every human life matters no matter what position they have in society. Poor or Rich, they deserve to live.
                        </p>

                    <div id="section">
						<h2 class="Stitle">End Corruption</h2>
						<p class="center">  
                            The impacts of corruption disproportionately affect the most vulnerable people in society.
                           Widespread corruption deters investment, weakens economic growth and undermines the rule of law. Stop corruption now and focus on improving the lives of the poor!
